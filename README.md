# Arcade Game Clone
Part of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree program, this project is a simple clone of the classic arcade game "Frogger." 
The goal of the game is to move the character across the stone road and into the water, while avoiding being struck by ladybugs. 
If the player's character comes into contact with a ladybug, the character will reset and the player will have to start over. Enjoy!

## Running the Game
To run the game, download the game's .zip files to your computer locally and run `index.html` inside your browser.

## Controls
Use the arrow keys `left`, `up`, `right`, and `down` to move the character in the corresponding direction.
